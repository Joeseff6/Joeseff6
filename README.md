__My name is Joseph Soria, and I am an aspiriring programmer! :computer:__

I have worked in the Oil and Gas industry for __about 10 years__, with experience in Quality and Supply Chain Management. With the hopes of changing my career path,
I undertook and completed the __Rice University Bootcamp for Full Stack Development__. I have a passion for thinking up ideas and projects, and bringing those ideas to life!
Putting in an input and seeing the output in real time is what I enjoy most in Full Stack developing.

__So why change my career path when I have years of experience in O&G?__ :question:

Throughout my years in this industry, I have learned much about business and how a business operates. But I don't see much growth where I'm at now,
and I don't have the same passion as I do when I write code. I see myself developing at a fast rate in the Tech industry, and most of all I'll actually be enjoying
what I do on the day to day basis.

__What do I have to offer?__ :pencil:

- I am a dedicated individual who likes to see my projects through with maximum effort
- I like to hold myself to a high standard, so I work to complete high quality projects
- I am an explorer in the tech industry, so when I don't understand something, I'll research online to better understand said thing
- Making people happy has always been a goal for me no matter what I'm doing, so I always listen to customer and project requirements
- I pride myself in finishing tasks on my own, so I aim to be self proficient in all my tasks and responsibilities
